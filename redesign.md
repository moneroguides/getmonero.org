# Getmonero.org Redesign



## Intro

Without metrics, this is all purely speculation and opinion, but hopefully it resonates with those interested such that these ideas can be adopted. This does not focus on aesthetics but content and structure and suggests a new framework from which to progress.

My approach is one loosely attributed to a rpg adventure. I would say 90% (sounds like a good figure) of people head to getmonero with something in mind. It’s the job of the website to lead them on a journey of self discovery. 

Attached to this is a diagram, which will hopefully be explained and justified in the following paragraphs. If the addition or removal of menus or content is not explicitly covered, it should then be implicit from other parts of the text.

Each proposed change will be annotated with a number and either (M) for menu or (C) for content, for reference. This text correlates directly to the attached diagram and addresses it from left to right.


## Getting Started

Getmonero.org is THE primary Monero centric website and is hosted by the core team. With that in mind, I would first like to discuss the [about](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/about/) page.


### About Getmonero.org

This page is currently focused on telling us about Monero. This is totally atypical; the about section of most websites cover information about those who host it. The current content is written as if Monero itself is reading you its biography.

(1) (C)I believe that for a new and more robust website to exist, this is the first thing that needs to addressed. In other words the “about” section needs to talk about the core team.

In the interest of being open, information about the website hosts should be some of the first accessible to the audience. (2)(M) To achieve this I propose that it be moved to the “getting started” directory under a new heading “About Getmonero.org”. (3)(C) On this page, information can be shared about Core, it’s affiliations (sponsorships) and the general fund, which is illustrated in the diagram.


### What is Monero?

(4)(C)There is a lot of good content in the “about” page which would be much better placed in the “What is Monero?” section. I would therefore suggest that this content be merged and moved accordingly.


### How to use Monero

With the subject of “core” and Monero as a concept out of the way, the obvious next step is to introduce ways for the audience to interact with the Monero ecosystem. Arguably introducing them to the community is just as important and for that reason “Community” is already, and should remain, a top level directory.

(5)(M)“How to use Monero” is in my opinion a much better approach than simply “Accepting”. I believe this page should be a comprehensive jumping off point for anyone wanting to use Monero software.

(6)(C) For this reason I suggest integrating the user guides into this section.


### How to mine Monero

(7)(C) The only part I think that needs to be separated from the current section of user guides is mining, which can easily be integrated into the already existing “Mining” subdirectory.

###  Project Development

Along with the addition of the “About Getmonero.org” I believe information about the projects development is also worthy of being under the “Getting started” directory. (8)(M)(C) Here I propose the integration of the current roadmap and the dev guides under a new subdirectory called “Project Development”.

For some time there has been discussion about recruiting talent to work on the Monero project and I believe a proper landing page would help achieve this.

### Merchants and Exchanges

(9)(M) There are two primary ways to obtain Monero, trading and mining. If “How to mine Monero” deserves to be in this directory, so do the exchanges. I would therefore like to see the pages moved from “Community” to this directory.

(10)(C)In addition to the information already here, I would also like to see the addition of an appropriate warning about Monero and CEXs. With reference to users not being able to guarantee their funds are not fractionally reserved.

###  FAQ

I like the FAQ as it is, it offers itself up as a decent method of short cutting your way to the appropriate articles 


## News

(11)(M) There are many ways to keep up to date with the Monero project and community and I think the currently titled “Blog” needs to be renamed to “News” to reflect this.

(12)(C) I would argue that reputable and community funded sources /articles should be added to this page; they include RSS feeds from, but not limited to monero.observer and localmonero.

!How this page evolves is an important point of discussion and needs attention!


## Community

(13)(M) I propose 2 subdirectories for the community tab, “Work Groups” and “Socials”. There should be a clear distinction between the two.

(14)(C) There is lots of content in the existing hangouts, which duplicates content or would be better placed in the “Work Groups” directory.

(15)(M)(C)  “Socials” is meant as a more inclusive renaming of “hangouts”. And should include all the appropriate subreddits, matrix channels, telegram channels. Is Facebook still used? If not, it should be destroyed.

## Crowd Funding

(16)(M)(C) Crowd funding is an important part of the Monero community, for this reason I propose a new top level directory called just that.

(17)(C) Included should be all the ways one can donate and get funded should they have a worthy idea. The emergence of different trusted platforms should be reflected here.

## Resources

By now lots of the content what was located in resources has been moved elsewhere. (18)(C)(M) To consolidate what is left I propose 3 subdirectories: “Software”, “Library” and “Presskit”.

(19)(C) “Software” is meant host the existing “Tools” and “Downloads” directories as new subdirectories. This will take some work to get it looking decent as the current “Dowloads” page has a lot of content. 

(20)(C) “Library” should include MRL content and “Moneropedia”. (21)(M) I envision the “Library” page could look like the current “Downloads” and “Blog” pages. With the subheadings illustrated by the diagram.
